        ... I am currently a first-year student at ENSC, a cognitive engineering
        school located in Bordeaux. I have a strong passion for UI and UX
        design, and I find the accessibility aspect particularly interesting.
        This background has given me a solid foundation in designing
        user-friendly interfaces.

        I've been drawing for nearly twenty years, and my enthusiasm for it has
        never waned. I draw inspiration from many talented artists to push the
        boundaries of my own artistic capabilities. Drawing and design share a
        lot in common, and my passion for both stems from my desire to create.
        While I have some experience providing services to clients, these
        projects were not professional or paid. Nevertheless, they taught me the
        basics of managing deadlines, handling client feedback, and more.
        Although I draw a lot for myself, my favorite moments are when I create
        art for others.

        Recently, I have been increasingly interested in web design. I believe
        that my current drawing skills can be a significant asset in this field.
        Beyond the assignments required by my school, I love to explore new
        design projects on my own. My desire to improve and progress is driven
        by a genuine passion for creation. I particularly enjoy working with
        CSS, finding joy in the intricacies of styling web pages.{" "}

        In addition to my academic and artistic pursuits, I have been playing
        volleyball for eight years. This sport has taught me the importance of
        teamwork and pushing myself beyond my limits. I also have a keen
        interest in photography, videography, and animationâ€”essentially anything
        related to creation. These hobbies allow me to continuously expand my
        creative horizons.
